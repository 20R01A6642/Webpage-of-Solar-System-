# Webpage-of-Solar-System-
The project is a simple webpage that displays a model of the solar system using HTML5, CSS, jQuery, and AJAX. The webpage shows a 2D representation of the solar system with the Sun at the center and the planets orbiting around it. 
The planets are represented by images loaded from URLs specified in a `planets.json` file, which is loaded using AJAX. The planets are positioned using CSS absolute positioning and animated using jQuery to simulate their orbital motion.
